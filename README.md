# ps
ps (particle screen) is a script for cube2 sauerbraten that allows creating fully interactive screens that use particle entities as pixels (works only in co-op edit obviously)

edit:
i wrote this garbage when i was learning cubescript and i didn't know what i was doing half of the time
also i'm never going to finish this
